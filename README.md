# nlp_assignments

Three different projects, developed using Python for a Natural Language Process (NLP) course of my Master's degree in Cognitive Science and Language. 

Each project deals with different issues:
1. Zipf's Law of Abbreviation
2. Character-based Language Models
3. Text Emotion Recognition

In each project folder you can find:
- Python script: the code used for the project was ran with Jupiter notebook (.ipynb file)
- Eventual .txt files with the text analysed in the project
- Project report: in the latex folder, stored in the pdf file named "main.pdf"
