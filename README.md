# nlp_assignments

Three different projects, developed using Python, for a Natural Language Process course of my Master's degree in Cognitive Science and Language. 

Each project deals with different issues:
1. Zipf's Law of Abbreviation
2. Character-based Language Models
3. Text Emotion Recognition

In each project folder you can find:
- the Python script
- the project report

The project report can be found in the latex folder, opening the pdf file named "main.pdf".
