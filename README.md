# nlp_assignments

Three different projects made ad assignments for my Natural Language Process class of the Master in Cognitive Science and Language. 
For each exsercise the description of the project can be found in the main.pdf file present in the folder "latex_file". 
To have a summary:
- the first exrcise deals with the Zipf's Law of Abbreviation
- the second one on character-based language models
- the last one on text emotion recognition
